Here you can find the web site used for SMASH 2017 in Trondheim, which I was the last one to work on.

The folder `src` contains the original files (like the PHP files) that were originally ran at a server hosted by Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I used the program WinHTTrack to create HTML files from the PHP files, and the `localhost` folder is thus a working static file copy of the site. The files and folders outside of the two mentioned folders (and except this Readme) was created by WinHTTrack.
